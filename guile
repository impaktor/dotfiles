;; NEWS Guile 2.0.10
;; Guile's core reader and printer now support the R7RS |...| notation
;; for writing symbols with arbitrary characters, as a more portable and
;; attractive alternative to Guile's native #{...}# notation.  To enable
;; this notation by default, put one or both of the following in your
;; ~/.guile:
; (read-enable  'r7rs-symbols)
; (print-enable 'r7rs-symbols)
